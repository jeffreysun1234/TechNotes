# Repository and DAO

In conclusion, they have similar intentions only that the Repository is a higher level concept dealing directly with business/domain objects, while DAO is more lower level, closer to the database/storage dealing only with data. A (micro)ORM is a DAO that is used by a Repository. 

For data-centric apps, a repository and DAO are interchangeable because the ‘business’ objects are simple data.
